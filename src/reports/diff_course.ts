// On the destination course side...
// Use this course on the left, [courses dropdown] on the right (remember frequently accessed choices in starred menu via localstorage)
// Find possible courses based on the previous Content Migrations (look for the biggest canvas_course_copy migration as a heuristic?)
// Accordion or tree or something to let us go through categories of resource types. Allow to quickly search and filter the list.
//    Goal should be to highlight things that have changed, especially HTML, I think.
// Diff multiple dimensions of data and information depending on diff settings.
// Have a convenient way to "push" and "pull" settings between courses (and an "undo" for those)


// Pair up items 
// go through all items in the courses, find all differences

/*

*/

// On the source course side, if you open up a specific assignment, it can show "courses to copy to" as a multi-select list?
// Definitely want a favorites sort of thing there

// Same mechanisms to determine if there's a related entity already
